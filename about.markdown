### Writing 
I use this site to document my thoughts. These days, those thoughts are usually centered around two burning questions: 
```
- What does it mean to have a good life? 
- How must I proceed in order to achieve that?
```

My posts will most likely be equal parts philosophical, incomprehensible, and hopefully humorous. You can probably expect a depressing post or two as well. 


### Work
I'm a data scientist by day. If you're wondering what that means, you're not alone - I'm still figuring it out myself.
I learn best by doing, and can often only validate those learnings through explanation. This is a space to do that.


### Other
I call Toronto ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ home, by way of Lagos, Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬. I enjoy spending time with family and friends, cycling, and reading.
