## this site
My goal is to write more consistently about whatever interests me, primarily as a means of learning. This site is an outlet for that. These days I am trying to become a better programmer, and find the meaning of life (help needed pls).


## me
I'm a data scientist based in Toronto, which is a long way from Lagos, Nigeria (where I was raised). I have a strong aversion to cars and streetcar tracks (I'm a cyclist, sorry), and am an advocate for more car-free spaces in urban areas.


## my work
I am currently unemployed, or "in between things" as they say these days. I previously worked at Shopify, by way of Capital One. I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot of things at both, I think (it's hard to keep track these days). Prior to that, I studied engineering at University of Toronto. It was okay.


## my interests
I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, staying active, and learning about obscure things on the internet.
